~~~~BACKGROUND~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This app was created as a final group project for the JavaScript module at the Flatiron School's immersive software engineering bootcamp. We wanted to make a fun and interactive game and use voice recognition to put a more unique spin on a classic jumper-game format.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~HOW-TO~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use this game, you'll have to allow your browser to access your computer's microphone. Once you start, the goal of the game is to say (out loud) the on-screen words as they come up. If you're able to do so within the given amount of time, and if you say the correct word, your sprite will jump over the corresponding obstacle.
